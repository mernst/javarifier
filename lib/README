javari/javarifier/lib contains:

plume.jar
    From http://code.google.com/p/plume-lib/

jasminclasses-2.4.0.jar
polyglotclasses-1.3.5.jar
sootclasses-2.4.0.jar
    Three jarfiles containing Soot, downloaded
    from http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/
    These are not in src/soot, since that directory only contains the classes
    we modified.  Alternatively, all of these classes could have been added
    into that directory, but there is no need.
