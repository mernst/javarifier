# javari/javarifier/lib contains three jarfiles containing Soot, downloaded
# from http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/
# These are not in src/soot, since that directory only contains the classes
# we modified.  Alternatively, all of these classes could have been added
# into that directory, but there is no need.
