Outline of possible Javarifier paper

  - Motivate Javari

  - Type inference Algorithm (type inference and heuristics)

      - Implementation
      - User Model

  - Annotation implemenation of Javari (short, 1 column description)

  - Case Studies

      - What other RO type systems exist?
          - compare UMD, Berkeley, JML, JAC, Shay's mutability
      - Javari scales (+ speed)
      - Javarifier scales (+ speed)
      - Javarifier accuracy
          - How many hand edits
              - Examples of problems
              - How many hand annotations/iterations required
          - Ask human experts
              - possible code bases: JDK, Daikon, Javac, Shay's case studies
              - They examine results
              - They annotate signatures and absract state
                  - compare blank run
                  - seed javarifier
          - Find anotated code
              - JML/ESC
              - Javarifier
              - index library
              - Adrian's hand annotations (javari 2004)
                  - JDK
                  - Daikon
          - How easy to debug problems
          - Compare tgo David greenfieldboyce tool
      - Javari usability
          - How many casts and annotations
          - classfile size increase
          - readability
      - How many bugs found. 

Tasks:

  - jhp - 15 to 20 days - Implement readonly type checker
  - jq  - 5 to 9 days   - Annotation-file to source code inserter
  - jq  - 3 days        - Describe type-inference algorithm
  - jq  - 7 days        - Find annotated code in JML/ESC and draw comparisons
