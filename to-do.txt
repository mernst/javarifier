Testing:
 * Run Javarifier on all of Daikon.
 * Run Javari Checker on all subject programs.
 * Set up circular test system between Javari type-checker and Javarifier.
 * Add annotation scene library as a test case, using the compiler and
   annotation file utilities to extract the correct annotations
   from the manually-annotated source code.

Profile javarifier to determine why it takes so much longer to run on
eclipsec than it does on htmlparser and tinySQL.

Possibly find more heuristics for inferring assignable and mutable
field annotations.

Check that Javadoc does not have any instances of <T> that should really be
&lt;T&gt; because <T> does not show up when generated Javadoc .html file is
viewed in a browser.  (Sadly, &lt;T&gt; is less readable.)
