Run Javari checker on all subject programs.

Run Javarifier on all of Daikon.

Add annotation scene library as a test case, using the compiler and
annotation file utilities to extract the correct annotations
from the manually-annotated source code.

Profile javarifier to determine why it takes so much longer to run on
eclipsec than it does on htmlparser and tinySQL.

Set up circular test system between javari type checker and javarifier.

Possibly find more heuristics for inferring assignable and mutable
field annotations.

Having "<T>" in Javadoc comments makes the comment more readable, but then
the "<T>" does not show up when the generated Javadoc .html file is viewed
in a browser.  Is there any way around this?
(Perhaps run a postprocessor on the generated .html files?)
(Maybe Eclipse's Javadoc generator has a workaround for this?)
