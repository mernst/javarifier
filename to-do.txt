Find a better place for annotations/builder/README.txt .. This is more of a
cross-project task

Move javari repository from CVS to SVN?

Run javari checker on all subject programs

Run javarifier on all of Daikon

Add annotation scene library as a test case, using the compiler and
annotation file utilities to extract the correct annotations
from the manually-annotated source code

Profile javarifier to determine why it takes so much longer to run on
eclipsec than it does on htmlparser and tinySQL

Set up circular test system between javari type checker and javarifier

Possibly find more heuristics for inferring assignable and mutable
field annotations.

I (Jaime) think that having "<T>" in Javadoc makes the code readable, and
the Javadoc is generated just fine.  However, Mike says to use "&lt;T&gt;"
instead.  I changed the javadoc to use that format, and it also appears
correct in the html, but is no longer readable in the code.  I think maybe
Eclipse's javadoc generator does html cleanup to no recognize generic types
as HTML.  Is this enough to justify changing the Javadoc back to "<T>"?
